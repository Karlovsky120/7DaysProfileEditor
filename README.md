# 7DaysProfileEditor
Tool for editing *.ttp files made for 7 Days To Die

First of all, anyone can contribute to this project! Fork the repository, do what you want and create a pull request. If whatever you did is within reson, I'll add it as is, or with minor modifications to better fit into the project as whole. You can always ask me if you're unsure. =)

If you want to download the tool and you're unsure how, go to bin/Win32/release and get the exe in there. Any exe within the bin folder should work if you have an apropriate system, the release versions should be slightly faster then the debug ones. I had trouble with starting the release version once, so I'm including both here should anyone experience a similar issue.

As far as licensing goes, you can do everything short of making money from this. I'd also appreciate if you'd link to this repository, should you want to distribute this further in any form, but that's up to you.
